Notes for general events:



Notes for the Halloween event:
	Idea of the event:
		-PvE (Players vs Mobs) event
		-People are given around 20 minutes (can be changed) to get gear and build defences
		-After the 20 minutes are up, mobs will start spawning outside the walls of the village, and people will try to survive
		-Mobs will most likely be spawned in waves, either by the EC or via command blocks. 
			-If they are spawned by the EC, they will communicate with each other on what theme the wave is.
		-People can run into the forest if they are feeling adventurous to find loot at the cost of safety.
		
	RULES:
		-You cannot just hide yourself in a dirt cage not do anything (So, actually fight lol)
		-It is highly discouraged to use a texture pack that removes the texture of a pumpkin when wearing it, especially if you're planning on wearing a pumpkin. Bleh
		-All of the eGO rules still apply, and that's pretty much saying: Don't be stupid.
		-Try not to ghost if you're in spectator mode. Like seriously, don't.
		-Feel free to break down anything you want, and build overtop anything you want assuming it's not griefing
		
	Constants:
		-Big water sources (lakes, oceans, etc.) should be the only place with lapis in them
			-So don't ever use lapis or build with lapis
		-The nether or the end cannot be accessed
			-So try not to use many nether-related items for rewards, or build with nether/end items.
			-Nether items pretty much cannot be accessed until you get to the crator area.
		-PvP is not allowed, and ECs will not be "super mobs". They will instead be summmoning mobs assuming command blocks aren't there to assist
		-If people die, they can respawn in the middle of the village. Their items will be like normal: they disappear after 5 minutes.
			-However, if they die during the night, they will be stuck in spectator mode. Rip :(
		-Obsidian shouldn't ever be used in large amounts for buildings, because tnt will be a thing that exists and will happen during then night.
			-That being said, don't put obsidian/bedrock on the village's walls.
		-Do not build structures with valuable blocks, because people can just break it down and use it. (Unless those blocks are rewards for completeing a task.)
		-Don't have potatoes in the main village, unless that secondary village doesn't exist.
		-Don't overuse lava (have maybe 1-10 source blocks in one area AT A TIME.)
	
	General Ideas:
		-Always consider the fact that people can break through blocks and build their way over obstacles
			-Example: mazes can just be broken through.
		-Lava should remain scarce to prevent people from using lava against mobs (The lava in the caves will most likely be removed.)
		-The walls will be blown up half way through the event to allow mobs to get past those defences
		-The entire area around the village will be a roofed forest (regular oak trees, dark oak trees, giant mushrooms)
		-If people go outside the walls and into the roofed forest, they will have to wear a pumpkin on their head to avoid being poisoned
			-The poison radius will not affect the players underneath the roofed forest, or in water
			-It will be controlled with command blocks
		-Puzzles and chests and rewards are amazing. However, don't go full hunger-games style and overdo the chests. They should feel special, not like an everyday appearance.
		-If there are any mazes, they will be randomized regardless of what you do so the builders don't remember the paths.
		-The roofed forest will be riddled with mob spawners for normal mobs like zombies, skeletons, spiders and creepers.
			-These monster spawners will be more common as they get close to the border / deeper into the forest
		
		
	To do list (buildings):
		Actually needed:
			-A couple more buildings around the village
			-Some sort of wall around the village
			-Smoothen out the hill thing
		Other that would be nice to have but is completely unnecessary
			-A secondary small-ish village area around a river that seemingly mastered irrigation (they will have potatoes and cocoa beans)
			-
			
			
	Other things:
		-A copy of the landscape before buildings can be found at ./warp halloween3 (don't you dare mess with this. there's a clear difference since this is in a plains biome.)
		-Passive mobs: decide on number
